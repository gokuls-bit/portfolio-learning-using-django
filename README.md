# Gokul Sant - Professional Portfolio



Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a modern, interactive, and fully responsive showcase of my skills, projects,  and professional experience as a multidisciplinary developer and innovator. It is built with a custom, high-performance front-end using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by a robust Django backend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The project leverages a modern, efficient technology stack for both the frontend and backend.

* **Frontend**:

* **Backend**:
    * **Python**: The core language for the backend logic.
    * **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development, security, and scalability.
    * **SQLite / PostgreSQL**: Database management for the contact form and potential future features.
